# Hand Gesture Recognition Model 

Iâ€™m glad to share one of my recent projects: a **Hand Gesture Recognition Model** built using **Python, TensorFlow, and Keras**! ðŸš€

## Overview:
This model recognizes six different hand gestures: **NONE, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, and FIVE**. It uses **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to process grayscale images and achieve high accuracy.

## Key Features:
- **Accuracy:** 93.9% (training), 99.6% (validation)
- **Loss:** 0.0211
- **Techniques:** Data augmentation, early stopping, and model checkpointing.

## Tech Stack:
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Tools & Libraries:** ImageDataGenerator, and more.

## What I Learned:
This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- CNNs
- Hyperparameter tuning
- The importance of robust data preprocessing
